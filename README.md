# kNearestNeighbours

**Overview**

This program is an implementation of the K nearest neighbours algorithm for a school project.

**Functionality**

* It reads a learning and test sample from a .csv file
* Classifies the test cases based on the learned cases
* Creates a confusion matrix
* Calculates accuracy, precision, recall and F-score

**Sources**

It is based on the program from this repository: https://github.com/nsadawi/KNN/tree/95d6fe43f1f2814c8c78f1b9c806199f52f52071 .

I added the .csv parsing for more test cases, confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall and F-score.
